# TempProject
Currently, this is a project that I quickly made to give a base understanding of my capabilities as a front-end software engineer.  I kept this name so I can to evolve this in my free time to act as a recipe box to help manage, tag, convert, and store what you'd like to cook.  That project is going to take some time, and I want to add a couple of other smaller demos that I'll make first.  So much to do, but I will slowly be adding things when I am able!  First thing I'll get done is a pokemon react project by 10/15/2021.


To run project:
> yarn install

> yarn start

will run on port 3000
